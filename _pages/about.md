I'm a first-year graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Montreal and also a member of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA - Quebec AI Institute), which is headed by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/).
Before joining MILA, I worked with Machine Learning on Graphs team (headed by [Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan)) at IBM Research, India and Natural Language Processing team (headed by [Dr. Haris Pozidis](https://research.ibm.com/people/haris-pozidis)) at IBM Research, Zurich. Prior to that, I joined IBM Research, Almaden and IBM System Development Lab to build software products centered around applying Machine Learning in storage and hardware applications. I also spent a great time at IIT Kanpur, applying machine learning to data structure tasks under the supervision of [Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://iitk.ac.in/new/arnab-bhattacharya).

# Research Topic
My general area of research is Machine Learning, focusing on *ML on Graphs*, *Computer Vision*, and *Natural Language Processing*. I'm also interested in developing inventive AI solutions for real-world problems by thriving the applicability of AI in various fields.
