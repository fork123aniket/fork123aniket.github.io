I'm a final year Master's student of *Machine Learning* at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), a member of the [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/en/) (*MILA - Quebec AI Institute*), which is headed by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/). I was a main contributor to [PyTorch Geometric](https://pyg.org/) library (an open-source extension of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to apply deep learning on Graphs). In addition, I worked with the *Multimodal Generative AI team* at [HumanWare Technologies](https://www.humanware.com/en-canada/) to help visually impaired users navigate complex environments using *Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)*. 

<!--I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Mercor. I finished my Master's Degree in *Machine Learning* from the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), was a member of the [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/en/) (*MILA - Quebec AI Institute*), which is headed by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), and a main contributor to [PyTorch Geometric](https://pyg.org/) library (an open-source extension of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to apply deep learning on Graphs).

Before joining *MILA*, I worked with *Machine Learning on Graphs team* (headed by [Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan)) at [IBM Research, India](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india) and *Natural Language Processing team* (headed by [Dr. Haris Pozidis](https://research.ibm.com/people/haris-pozidis)) at [IBM Research, Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/). Meanwhile, I joined [IBM Research, Almaden](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) and [IBM Systems Development Lab](https://www.ibm.com/storage) to build software products centered around applying Machine Learning in storage and hardware applications. I also spent a great time at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), applying machine learning to data structure tasks under the supervision of [Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://iitk.ac.in/new/arnab-bhattacharya). Moreover, I had the good fortune to work with [Dr. Matthias Fey](https://rusty1s.github.io/#/) at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) in Germany, focusing on devising novel model-agnostic graph explainability solutions.

# AI Interests
My general area of research is Machine Learning, focusing on *ML on Graphs*, *Computer Vision*, *Natural Language Processing*, *Multimodal Learning using Large Language Models (LLMs)*, *Generative AI*, and primarily *Design and Scale ML Systems for Production*. I'm also interested in developing inventive AI solutions for real-world problems by thriving the applicability of AI in various fields.
