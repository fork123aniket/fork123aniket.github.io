# ![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
I'm a first year graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Montreal and also a member of Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA - Quebec AI Institute), which is headed by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/).
Before joining MILA, I worked with Machine Learning on Graphs team (headed by [Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan)) at IBM Research India and Natural Language Processing team (headed by [Dr. Haris Pozidis](https://research.ibm.com/people/haris-pozidis)) at IBM Research Zurich. Prior to that, I joined IBM Research Almaden and IBM System Development Lab to build software products centered around applying Machine Learning in storage and hardware applications.
I also spent a great time at IIT Kanpur, applying machine learning on data structure tasks under the supervision of [Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://iitk.ac.in/new/arnab-bhattacharya).

# Research Topic
My general area of research is MAchine Learning, focusing on *ML on Graphs*, *Computer Vision*, *Natural Language Processing*. I'm also interested in developing inventive AI solutions for real-world problems by thriving the applicability of AI in various fields.

# 🔬 My research interests are in bridging vision and language modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!

# 📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

# 📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
# # I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
# # I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

# To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

# Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
# # Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
# # There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
# # To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
