I'm a first-year graduate student in *Computer Science* at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), a member of the [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/en/) (*MILA - Quebec AI Institute*), which is headed by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/), and a main contributor to [PyTorch Geometric](https://pyg.org/) library (an open-source extension of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to apply deep learning on Graphs). Before joining *MILA*, I worked with *Machine Learning on Graphs team* (headed by [Balaji Ganesan](https://research.ibm.com/people/balaji-ganesan)) at [IBM Research, India](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india) and *Natural Language Processing team* (headed by [Dr. Haris Pozidis](https://research.ibm.com/people/haris-pozidis)) at [IBM Research, Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/). Meanwhile, I joined [IBM Research, Almaden](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) and [IBM Systems Development Lab](https://www.ibm.com/storage) to build software products centered around applying Machine Learning in storage and hardware applications. I also spent a great time at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), applying machine learning to data structure tasks under the supervision of [Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://iitk.ac.in/new/arnab-bhattacharya). Moreover, I had the good fortune to work with [Dr. Matthias Fey](https://rusty1s.github.io/#/) at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) in Germany, focusing on devising novel model-agnostic graph explainability solutions.
