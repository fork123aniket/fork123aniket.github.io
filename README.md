My personal academic website, forked from the [***Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme***](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is ***Â© 2016 Michael Rose*** and ***released under the MIT License***. See LICENSE.md.

## Enhancements
I found this [***issue***](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/137) in the [***academicpages***](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository about a change in the theme of the overall academic website. Being fond of `dark theme`, I tried to make the website appear with `dark theme` to some extent. Yet, I see some dropdown options still visible inappropriately (in the sense that they appear with `white` font color), which needs to be fixed.
