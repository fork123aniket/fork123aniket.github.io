- This contribution relates to bringing attention to heterogeneous (relational) graphs and incorporating this
relation-aware attention operator into PyTorch Geometric Library.
- Offers two different mechanisms to compute attention for relational graphs, i.e. **within-relation** and **across-relation**.
- This implementation also provides four different cardinality preservation options (**additive**, **scaled**, **f-additive**, and
**f-scaled**) to further improve attention computation for the heterogeneous graphs.
- Wrote custom unit tests to verify the techniqueâ€™s accuracy.
